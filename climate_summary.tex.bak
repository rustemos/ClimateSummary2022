Atmospheric CO$_2$concentrations reflect a balance between emission sources and sinks. Raising global CO$_2$ concentrations reflect the budget between extra emissions due to human activities and uptake by the biosphere and ocean.}

The six data sets place 2021 between the 5th and 7th warmest year on record. The seven warmest years on record were between 2015 and 2021.

        \item[o] Oceans cover about 70\% of the earth's surface and have high capacity to absorb extra heat trapped by the CO$_2$ and other greenhouse gases. The ocean takes up more than 90\% of the excess energy accumulating in the Earth climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. Melting of the ice sheet and thermal expansion from ocean warming lead to a sea level rise, which impacts coastlines. Changes in ocean chemistry associated with rising CO$_2$ concentrations in the atmosphere are causing aciditification of the oceans, with negative consequences for the marine biosphere.

Regional emissions are net of carbon embedded in imports of goods and services from other regions.
