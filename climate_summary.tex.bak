Atmospheric CO$_2$concentrations reflect a balance between emission sources and sinks. Raising global CO$_2$ concentrations reflect the budget between extra emissions due to human activities and uptake by the biosphere and ocean.}

The six data sets place 2021 between the 5th and 7th warmest year on record. The seven warmest years on record were between 2015 and 2021.

        \item[o] {\cb Right:} Global mean ocean heat content relative to 1955 for depths of 0 to 700~meters in light blue and 700 to 2000~meters in dark blue. 

        \item[o] Oceans cover about 70\% of the earth's surface and have high capacity to absorb extra heat trapped by the CO$_2$ and other greenhouse gases. The ocean takes up more than 90\% of the excess energy accumulating in the Earth climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. Melting of the ice sheet and thermal expansion from ocean warming lead to a sea level rise, which impacts coastlines. Changes in ocean chemistry associated with rising CO$_2$ concentrations in the atmosphere are causing aciditification of the oceans, with negative consequences for the marine biosphere.

Total global CO$_2$ emissions in 2019 were 50 billion tonnes. After 1990, emissions include carbon and other greenhouse gases embedded in imports/exports of goods and services from/to other regions. {\it Close to half (46\%) of historical CO$_2$ emissions were released after 1990.}

Regional emissions are net of carbon embedded in imports of goods and services from other regions.
