        \item[o] {\cb Left:} Average global CO$_2$ concentration (parts per million) from 1984 to 2020. The red line is the monthly mean without seasonal variations.

        \item[o] {\it Increasing levels of CO$_2$ and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are a major driver of climate change.} Atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations reflect a balance between emission sources and sinks. Raising global CO$_2$ concentrations reflect the budget between extra emissions due to human activities and uptake by the biosphere and ocean.

        \item[o] {\cb Right:} Mean global temperature from 1850 to 2021. The global temperature in 2021 was $1.11 \pm 0.13~^{\circ}$C above the 1850-1900 average. The six data sets place 2021 between the 5th and 7th warmest year on record. {\it The seven warmest years on record were between 2015 and 2021.}

        \item[o] Cooler conditions in Southern Africa, India, and eastern Australia are characteristic of La Ni√±a. The cooler-than-average area in Northern Asia stands in contrast to 2020, which saw exceptionally high temperatures in the region.

        \item[o] {\cb Left:} Global mean sea level evolution from January 1993 to January 2022 (black curve) based on high-precision satellite altimetry. The coloured straight lines represent the average linear trend over three successive time spans: 1993-2002; 2003-2012; 2013-2022.

        
        \item[o] {\cb Right:} Global mean ocean heat content relative to 1955 for depths of 0 to 700~meters in light blue and 700 to 2000~meters in dark blue. 

        \item[o] Oceans cover about 70\% of the earth's surface and have high capacity to absorb extra heat trapped by the CO$_2$ and other greenhouse gases. {\it The ocean takes up more than 90\% of the excess energy accumulating in the Earth climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.} Melting of ice sheets and thermal expansion of warming oceans lead to a sea level rise, impacting coastlines. Rising CO$_2$ concentrations in the atmosphere change ocean chemistry, causing acidification of the oceans, with negative consequences for marine biosphere.
