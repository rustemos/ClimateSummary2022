        \item[o] {\it Increasing levels of CO$_2$ and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are a major driver of climate change.} Atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations reflect a balance between emission sources and sinks. Raising global CO$_2$ concentrations reflect the budget between extra emissions due to human activities and uptake by the biosphere and ocean.

        \item[o] {\cb Right:} Mean global temperature from 1850 to 2021. The global temperature in 2021 was $1.11 \pm 0.13~^{\circ}$C above the 1850-1900 average. The six data sets place 2021 between the 5th and 7th warmest year on record. {\it The seven warmest years on record were between 2015 and 2021.}

Rising CO$_2$ concentrations in the atmosphere change ocean chemistry, causing acidification of the oceans, with negative consequences for marine biosphere.

Regional emissions are net of carbon embedded in imports of goods and services from other regions.

This is not the case for the top half of the population. Large inequalities in emissions suggest that climate policies should target wealthy polluters more. So far, climate policies such as carbon taxes have often disproportionately impacted low and middle-income groups, while leaving the consumption habits of wealthiest groups unchanged.
