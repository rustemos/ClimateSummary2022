        \item[o] Illustrative scenarios for five possible socio-economic pathways starting in 2015, with their corresponding anthropogenic CO$_2$ and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They are referred to as the Shared Socio-economic Pathways and they are labelled as SSPx-y, with x ranging from 1 to 5, and y referring to the approximate level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre).

        \item[o] {\cb SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5} are scenarios with high and very high greenhouse gas emissions that roughly double from current levels by 2100 and 2050, respectively. 
        
        \item[o] {\cb SSP2-4.5} is a scenario with these emissions remaining around current levels until the middle of the century, then starting to decline. 
        
        \item[o] {\cb SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6} are scenarios with very low and low emissions, declining to net zero around 2050, followed by varying levels of net negative CO$_2$ emissions due to anthropogenic removals of CO$_2$.

          \item[o] {\cb Left:} Past greenhouse gas and CO$_2$ emissions since 1750 have committed the global ocean to future warming (high confidence). Mountain and polar glaciers are committed to continue to melt for decades or centuries (very high confidence). {\it Loss of permafrost carbon following permafrost thaw is irreversible at centennial time scales (high confidence).} Continued ice loss over the 21st century is virtually certain for the Greenland ice sheet and likely for the Antarctic ice sheet. 
  
          \item[o] {\cb Right:} It is virtually certain that global mean sea level will continue to rise over the 21st century. Relative to 1995-2014, the likely global mean sea level rise by 2100 is 0.28-0.55~meter even under the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), and is 0.32-0.62~meter under the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6). Global mean sea level rise of about 2~meter by 2100 and 5~meter by 2150 under a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) (low confidence) cannot be ruled out due to deep uncertainty in ice-sheet processes.
