        \item[o] {\cb Left:} This graph shows the breakdown of the global CO$_2$ emissions by major economic regions as a function of time. Total global CO$_2$ emissions in 2019 were 50 billion tonnes. After 1990, emissions include carbon and other greenhouse gases embedded in imports/exports of goods and services from/to other regions. {\it Close to half (46\%) of historical CO$_2$ emissions were released after 1990.}

        \item[o] {\cb Right:} The graph shows historical emissions by region (left bar) and the remaining global carbon budget (centre and right bars) to have 83\% chances to stay under 1.5°C and 2°C, according to IPCC Assessment Report 6 (2021). Regional emissions are net of carbon embedded in imports of goods and services from other regions.

        \item[o] CO$_2$ emissions of top 10\% of emitters per capita per year: 29 tonnes in Europe, 39 tonnes in East Asia, 73 tonnes in North America.

        \item[o] Poorest half of the population in rich countries is already at (or near) the 2030 climate per-capita targets set by rich countries. This is not the case for the top half of the population. Large inequalities in emissions suggest that climate policies should target wealthy polluters more. So far, climate policies such as carbon taxes have often disproportionately impacted low and middle-income groups, while leaving the consumption habits of wealthiest groups unchanged.
